# EcoMunch

Welcome to EcoMunch, the web app designed to revolutionize food container reuse and help you discover restaurants on Governors Island in NYC. Our focus is on security, practicality, functionality, and accessibility.

## Key Features

- **Security**: Your data is protected with advanced hashing algorithms to ensure privacy and safety, we never save your payment data!
- **Practicality**: Streamlined processes to ensure a seamless user experience. 
- **No Sign in!**: No need to sign in. Just scan a QR code to pull up the website and you're ready to go. 
- **Accessibility**: Designed to be easily accessible for everyone, without the need for downloads or sign-ins. We love our users and do right by them, we require almost no data from you, especially when paying electronically. Cash users are only required to give out their names and phone numbers for reward program purposes. 

## Why a Web App?

According to Pew Research Center and Statista, app engagement and user retention are significant challenges. Many apps experience high initial downloads but struggle to maintain user engagement over time. Since our app is designed for use in a small area, convincing users to download an app is even more of an uphill battle. 

**Why fight an uphill battle when you can go around it?**
The decision of making a webapp was very difficult since two of our teams developers are IOS developers, and making an iOS app would have been much easier. We still chose to go with a webapp since it makes more sense from a practical standpoint. 

## How It Works

1. Scan the QR code at participating locations.
2. Use the app to return used food containers and earn rewards.
3. Find and explore restaurants and return stations on Governors Island.
