# EcoMunch

Welcome to EcoMunch, the web app designed to revolutionize food container reuse and help you discover restaurants on Governors Island in NYC. Our focus is on security, practicality, functionality, and accessibility. Payment and automatic rewards integration for Vendors!

Ecomunch targets covers all demographics! Cash or Card? Doesn't matter, we got you covered!

## Key Features

- **Security**: Your data is protected with advanced hashing algorithms to ensure privacy and safety, we never save your payment data!
- **Practicality**: Streamlined processes to ensure a seamless user experience. 
- **No Sign in!**: No need to sign in. Just scan a QR code to pull up the website and you're ready to go. 
- **Accessibility**: Designed to be easily accessible for everyone, without the need for downloads or sign-ins. We love our users and do right by them, we require almost no data from you, especially when paying electronically. Cash users are only required to give out their names and phone numbers for reward program purposes. 

## Why a Web App?

According to Pew Research Center and Statista, app engagement and user retention are significant challenges. Many apps experience high initial downloads but struggle to maintain user engagement over time. Since our app is designed for use in a small area, convincing users to download an app is even more of an uphill battle. 

**Why fight an uphill battle when you can simply go around it?**
The decision of making a webapp was very difficult since two of our teams developers are IOS developers, and making an iOS app would have been much easier. We still chose to go with it since it makes more sense from a practical standpoint. 

## Why trust an app with your information?

Not all apps use hashing for sensitive data, but it's a best practice for secure applications. Apps dealing with personal informationâ€”like banking and healthcare typically use hashing to protect data.
However, some apps still store data in less secure ways, which is a risk for users. By using hashing, EcoMunch is taking extra steps to ensure your data is safe and secure.

## How It Works (User)

1. Scan the QR code at participating locations, you can find these codes all over Governers Island, then "click I am a user!" (look next to restaurants and on signboards)
2. If you are paying cash please put in your name and phone number (Conditional)
3. When paying for your food, you put down a 1 dollar deposit which is added to your bill. When the vendor processes your payment they tap the card on the vendor version of the app that automaticlly enters you into the reward system as well the database which connects you to your container. Each container has a unique 4-digit containerID, which is linked to the hashed card number at the point of sale
4. Find and explore restaurants and return stations on Governors Island
5. After finishing your delectible meal, head on to the map section to find one of our return stations
6. Once at the return station, scan your container and dip your card to get your deposit back. You can opt for cash or card deposit.
7. if you paid cash you can enter your phone number, and then opt for one of the two options for moneyback.
8. If you returned your own container you get a dollar of your deposit back. If you returned someone elses container, you make a 70 cent reward. When you return your own containers you can win rewards, such as coupons for your favorite restaurants on the island or merch!

* The reward is slightly lowered to account for Professor Samantha Macbrides concern of disorderly conduct like swiping of patron's wares and returning them for a profit.

## How it works (Vendor)

1. As a vendor, navigate to our website and register or sign in.
2. Create an account allows the user to file an application, which allows the vendor to submit a form to check eligibility for the program
3. after logging in the vendor can do inventory managment
4. They also dip the customers card on the purchase section while they pay so, it can be hashed
